## Instructions

**Task:** Open up the New York Times article [A Summer of Strikes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/03/business/economy/strikes-union-sag-uaw.html), and scroll down to the plot titled "Union membership has fallen sharply over the past four decades (Share of the work force in a union, by industry)".

![](https://hash-mac.github.io/stat212site-sp26/images/challenge-2-goal.png)

Using `ggplot2` and other tools in R, recreate this plot. Note that you will need to create the data underlying the plot yourself. You can create this data in R with `tibble()`. You can also write the data in Excel or Google Sheets and export it as a CSV file.

**Requirements:**

- Overall
  - Panels for "All workers", "By Sector", and "By Industry" are shown.
  - Arrows showing the change from 1983 to 2022 are shown.
    - Note: be sure that the arrows all point in the correct direction!
  - The actual percentages in 1983 and 2022 are shown as text.
  - X-axis tick marks are at 0, 25, and 50.
  - Plot title says "Union membership has fallen sharply over the past four decades".
  - Plot subtitle says "Share of the work force in a union, by industry".
- Resource reflection
    - At least 1 resource is listed
    - At least 3 sentences about resources and their helpfulness in the task

**Bonus**: Additional possibilities to enhance your visualization include adjusting the default aesthetics of the arrows, aligning your plots neatly, and adding margins in order to left-align the y-axis text. 





## Setup

```{r}
# Code for loading packages
# And code for reading in data if using the Excel/Google Sheets-->CSV approach
library(tidyverse)

```

```{r}
# Code for generating the data (if using the tibble() approach)
union <- tibble(
  panel = c(
    "All workers",
    "By sector", "By sector",
    "By industry", "By industry", "By industry", "By industry",
    "By industry", "By industry", "By industry", "By industry",
    "By industry", "By industry"
  ),
  category = c(
    "All workers",
    "Private sector", "Public sector",
    "Transportation and utilities",
    "Manufacturing",
    "Mining",
    "Construction",
    "Education and health",
    "Arts, entertainment and recreation",
    "Business services",
    "Retail, food and hospitality",
    "Public administration",
    "Agriculture"
  ),
  pct_1983 = c(20, 17, 37, 47, 28, 27, 28, 26, 17, 10, 8, 30, 5),
  pct_2022 = c(10, 6, 33, 16, 8, 7, 13, 17, 7, 3, 3, 28, 4))

head(union)
```




## Visualization


```{r}
# Code for recreating the visualization
# Use as many code chunks as you need to organize your work well

ggplot(union, aes(y = fct_rev(category))) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = pct_1983, xend = pct_2022, yend = category),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.15, "inches")),
    linewidth = 0.8,
    color = "#0B3C5D") +
  geom_text(
    aes(x = pct_1983, label = pct_1983),
    hjust = -0.3,
    size = 3) +
  geom_text(
    aes(x = pct_2022, label = pct_2022),
    hjust = 1.3,
    size = 3) +
  facet_grid(
    panel ~ .,
    scales = "free_y",
    space = "free_y") +
  scale_x_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 50),
    breaks = c(0, 25, 50)) +
  labs(
    title = "Union membership has fallen sharply over the past four decades",
    subtitle = "Share of the work force in a union, by industry",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL
  ) +
  
  theme_minimal() 


```



## Resources Reflection (required)

List the resources you used to help with this assignment then write 3-5 sentence reflection on which resources were most helpful in finishing this task.

**Resources:**
- ggplot2 reference page
- chatgpt

**Reflection:**
I found the geom_segment function on the ggplot2 reference page and looked up a couple of the parameters on google. Originally, I was using facet_wrap instead of facet_grid but the "by Industry" panel was squished and some of the words were overlapping because of the volume of tabs in that section so I asked chatgpt how I could space it out and it recommended facet_grid instead, which looks much cleaner.
