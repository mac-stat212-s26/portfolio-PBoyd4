    "text": "Discussion\nExamining median declared share capital reveals clear differences across both company size and legal nature. Unsurprisingly, median capital increases with size. Firms classified as “other” tend to have substantially higher median capital than micro and small enterprises, suggesting greater financial resources and higher barriers to entry. At the same time, legal structure matters independently of size: privately held corporations exhibit far higher median capital than limited liability companies, sole proprietorships, or silent partnerships. Together, these patterns indicate that both firm size and institutional form are strongly associated with capital intensity in Brazilian businesses. But, does the tendency for median capital stock to increase with company size prevail when you look at it within each each legal nature on its own.\n\nCodecompanies_top_legal |&gt;\n  group_by(company_size, legal_nature) |&gt;\n  summarize(median_capital = median(capital_stock), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  mutate(company_size = factor(company_size,\n                               levels = c(\"micro-enterprise\",\n                                          \"small-enterprise\",\n                                          \"other\")),\n         company_size = recode(company_size,\n                             \"micro-enterprise\" = \"Micro\",\n                             \"small-enterprise\" = \"Small\",\n                             \"other\" = \"Other\")) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = company_size, y = median_capital)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  facet_wrap(~ legal_nature) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Median Declared Share Capital by Company Size and Legal Nature\",\n    x = \"Company Size\",\n    y = \"Median Declared Share Capital (BRL)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()",

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis plot makes one pattern very clear: legal structure matters more than size. Privately held corporations have much higher median share capital than every other type at the micro-enterprise and “other” level, suggesting that incorporation is strongly tied to raising larger amounts of money. Sole proprietorships stay relatively low-capital across all sizes, but do stick with the trend of median capital increasing with size. LLCs and silent partnerships fall somewhere in the middle, with modest increases in capital for larger firms but nothing close to corporations. Overall, while capital tends to rise slightly with company size within each group, the differences in capital between legal types are much larger, indicating that how a business is organized legally has a stronger impact on share capital than how the size of the company.",

Using both the small thumbnail visuals on the right and the names of the geom’s, brainstorm some possibilities for geom’s you might use to recreate the temperature visualization.\ngeom_col() and geom_bar() are the only ones that seem like they could possibly create this visualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigating Documentation / Reference Pages\n\n\n\nYou need to navigate the geoms further by opening up their reference pages to understand if a particular geom is suitable for our task. Let’s look at the geom_point documentation page to learn how to read a documentation page..\nThe Usage section shows all of the possible inputs (arguments) to the geom. These are all of the ways that a geom can be customized. Just looking at the argument names can help give a hint as to what arguments might fit our needs.\nThe Arguments section, on the other hand, explains in detail what each argument does and the possible values the argument can take. The mapping, data, and ... arguments will be the most commonly used by far.\n\n\nmapping is the argument that is being used when we specify which variables should link or map to the plot aesthetics (the code inside aes()).\n\ndata is the argument where we specify the dataset containing the variables that the geom is using.\n\n... is used for fixed aesthetics (ones that don’t correspond to a variable), eg, to set the color of all points, we use color = \"red\" and to set the size of all points, we use size = 3.\n\nThe Aesthetics section of a geom documentation page gives information on how the visual elements of the geom correspond to data. For example, the geom_point documentation page shows that x and y aesthetics are available. It also shows some new aesthetics like stroke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata Argument\n\n\n\nPreviously you have used one dataset per plot by specifying that as the first argument of ggplot(). However, multiple data sets can be passed into ggplot as shown in the example below.\n\nCodedata(diamonds)\n\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds |&gt;\n  group_by(carat) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_price = mean(price)) |&gt;\n  arrange(carat)\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds_avg_price[seq(1, nrow(diamonds_avg_price), 3), ]\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = diamonds_avg_price,\n    aes(x = carat, y = avg_price),\n    color = \"deepskyblue\",\n    size = 3\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the geom_linerange documentation page and start off your temperature visualization with the record lows and highs.
